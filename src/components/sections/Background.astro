      I recently graduated with a B.S. degree in computer science from
      <Link href={links.northeastern}>Northeastern University</Link> after completing twoawesome six month co-ops as a
      software engineer at <Link href={links.intuit}>Intuit</Link> and
      <Link href={links.colgate}>Colgate-Palmolive</Link>.

      What I love about being a software engineer is the freedom to solve problems pragmatically and bring great ideas
      to fruition. I always strive to design and build applications that are efficient and scalable with an enjoyable
      user experience if applicable. Currently, my primary focus is to be able to continue building and learning as a
      software engineer in an environment that brings out the best in me.

      When Iâ€™m not in front of a computer screen you could probably catch me either cooking some delicious food or
      training at the local gym.
